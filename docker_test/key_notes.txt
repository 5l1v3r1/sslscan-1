There is one Certificate Authority in this directory: ca_cert.pem / ca_key.pem.

This CA directly signed these certificates (with their corresponding keys):
  * cert_1024.crt / key_3072.pem
  * cert_2048.crt / key_2048.pem
  * cert_3072.crt / key_3072.pem

The 1024, 2048, and 3072 refer to the RSA key size.
